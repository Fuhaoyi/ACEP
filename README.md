# ACEP
Open source software and datasets for the ACEP algorithm

1.Making predictions for sequences
---
1.1 Description
#
Input the peptide sequences and PSSM file, the model can predict whether the sequences are AMPs or non-AMPs. PSSM files of Sequences can be obtained through POSSUM website (http://possum.erc.monash.edu/). This software supports high-throughput predictions. The prediction results are stored in a file.

1.2 Requirements
#
Python3
Python packages: Tensorfollow(vr.1.6.0), Keras(vr.2.15), Matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and senborn(for Visualization).

Updating...

We are collating the codes, and the entire codes will be uploaded before December 31th.
